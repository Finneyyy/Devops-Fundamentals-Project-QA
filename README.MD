## Project Brief:
The brief for this project was as following:
    "Your overall objective with this project is the following:
    
    - To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies 
      that encapsulate all core modules covered during training."

## Requirements
• A Trello board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion
on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.
It could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced
creating your project.

• A relational database used to store data persistently for the
project, this database needs to have at least 2 tables in it, to
demonstrate your understanding, you are also required to model a
relationship.

• Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture
you will use for you project as well as a detailed Risk Assessment.

• A functional CRUD application created in Python, following best
practices and design principles, that meets the requirements set on
your Kanban Board
♦ Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as
well as automated tests for validation of the application. You must
provide high test coverage in your backend and provide consistent
reports and evidence to support a TDD approach.

• A functioning front-end website and integrated API's, using Flask.

• Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the
Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI
server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
